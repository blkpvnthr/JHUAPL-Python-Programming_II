Create a Python script that uses classes and attributes with the following directions.

Dog is a class. (instance attributes and instance methods)

1. init method initializes the instance attributes for new dog object created.

2. The description and speak methods are examples of instance methods on objectâ€™s attributes.

    - species, name, and breed are attributes.

    - species is a class attribute, while name and breed are instance attributes.

    - bark is a method.

    - dog1 and dog2 are instances (objects) of the Dog class.
